# Project 1: SQL to Tableau Dashboard Pipeline: Customer Refunds vs Contract Renegotiation Calculator
* Created SQL query to extract data from [Northwind Traders Database](https://www.geeksengine.com/article/northwind.html), which contains thousands of records across 13 tables of sales data for orders that shipped late.
* Inserted column for a fictional customer refund calculation of 60% on Gross Revenue on late orders.
* Create a map of most frequent late orders by country.
* Created overlapping bar chart of Gross Revenue vs refunds.
* Composed a Dashboard that allows input from management to measure costs of late fee renegotiation vs historical late fees.
