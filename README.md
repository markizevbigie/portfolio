# [Project 1: SQL to Tableau Dashboard Pipeline: Customer Refunds vs Contract Renegotiation Calculator](https://public.tableau.com/shared/M2CZ8TZRG?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
* Created SQL query to extract data from [Northwind Traders Database](https://www.geeksengine.com/article/northwind.html), which contains thousands of records across 13 tables of sales data for orders that shipped late.
* Inserted column for a fictional customer refund calculation of 60% of Gross Revenue on late orders.
